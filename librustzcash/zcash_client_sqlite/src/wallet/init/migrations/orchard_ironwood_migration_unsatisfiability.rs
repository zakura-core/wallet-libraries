//! Renames the pool-migration transfer ordinal from `tx_id` to `transfer_id`, adds the
//! `unsatisfiable_at`, `unsatisfiable_kind`, and `broadcast_failure_at` columns to
//! `orchard_ironwood_migration_transactions`, creates the
//! `orchard_ironwood_migration_spend_nullifiers` table and backfills the nullifier cache into it
//! for existing rows, restores the erased `txid` of every `mined` row, and adds the
//! `replan_threshold` column to `orchard_ironwood_migrations`.
//!
//! The rename removes a collision between two similarly spelled columns of
//! `orchard_ironwood_migration_transactions` that name unrelated things: the transaction's ordinal
//! WITHIN its migration (a `MigrationTransferId`, and the second half of the table's primary key,
//! which the dependency edges reference), and `txid`, the consensus transaction ID the transaction
//! was broadcast under. `transfer_id` names the first unambiguously, and the dependency table's two
//! columns follow it to `transfer_id` and `depends_on_transfer_id`, so no reader has to hold the
//! distinction in mind to read a query.
//!
//! `tx_id` is what [`orchard_ironwood_migration_tables`] creates, and — since that migration is
//! published — is what it will always create, from a frozen copy of the text a released build ran.
//! That is what makes EVERY step here unconditional: a database arrives at this migration in the
//! shape some released build created, whether that was an earlier release or the frozen copy a
//! moment ago, so both paths leave the same schema text behind.
//!
//! `unsatisfiable_at` records the height of the chain state a spent-input observation rests on,
//! when a migration transaction has been determined UNSATISFIABLE — its inputs can never again
//! all exist unspent on chain — and is `NULL` while no such determination stands. A rewind below
//! that height invalidates the observation itself, which is what reorg truncation clears the mark
//! by comparing against.
//!
//! `unsatisfiable_kind` records WHICH observation that was, as the wire name of an
//! `UnsatisfiableKind` (`inputs_spent`, `inputs_invalidated`, `anchor_invalidated`, or
//! `inherited` for a mark that arrived through the dependency closure rather than from anything
//! observed about the transaction itself). It is the mark's companion, not an independent
//! record: the two columns are `NULL` together or non-`NULL` together, and the store rejects a
//! row where they disagree. Existing rows need no backfill — a pre-existing database has no
//! `unsatisfiable_at` column either, so no mark can predate this one.
//!
//! `broadcast_failure_at` records the chain tip an application observed from a node that REJECTED
//! a broadcast of the transaction, and is `NULL` while no rejection stands unadjudicated. It is
//! testimony from another observer rather than an observation of this wallet's own, which is why
//! it is a separate column from the mark: it withholds the transaction from the broadcast queue
//! until the wallet has scanned to that tip and the engine can decide the question against
//! evidence. Existing rows need no backfill for the same reason the kind does not — a database
//! predating these columns recorded no such report.
//!
//! `orchard_ironwood_migration_spend_nullifiers` caches the nullifiers of each transaction's REAL
//! spends — the deferred-witness actions; the padded dummy spends carry their own witnesses (ZIP
//! 374) — one 32-byte row per nullifier, ordered by its position in the transaction's action
//! order. The cache is derivable from a not-yet-proven stored PCZT, but the pool-migration state
//! machine reads it through the store precisely so it never has to parse a PCZT (in the engine
//! crate, `pczt` parsing is `orchard`-gated while the state machine is feature-free). Existing
//! rows therefore must satisfy the same invariant the store's write path maintains, so this
//! migration derives the cache for them by parsing each row's stored PCZT — using the base `pczt`
//! data model, which needs no protocol feature. A stored PCZT that does not parse is corrupt state
//! and fails the migration, matching how the store's read paths reject data they cannot
//! reconstruct. So does a not-yet-`mined` row whose PCZT parses but yields NO real spends: that is
//! the shape of a PROVEN PCZT (proving installs the
//! deferred witnesses), from which the cache can no longer be reconstructed. A `mined` row with
//! such bytes is exempt and keeps an empty cache — hard-failing it would block every wallet
//! whose migration already completed, for no benefit while the row stays mined. The exemption
//! carries a residual hazard: mined-ness is chain-derived and revocable, so a chain rewind that
//! demotes such a row returns it to the watched set with an empty cache, which satisfiability
//! consumers must treat as loud corruption (the real spends were never identifiable), never as
//! a transaction with no inputs to observe.
//!
//! `txid` changes meaning: it is now every row's id, recorded when the transaction is BUILT,
//! rather than a value that appeared only once the transaction was broadcast. Two groups of rows
//! therefore need filling. Rows that never reached `broadcast` never had one; and `mined` rows lost
//! theirs to a published release, whose two store write paths bound the column through one accessor
//! that answered `None` for `mined`. The reconstructing reader now requires the column on every
//! row, so without this repair a wallet with a migration in any state could stop reading its store
//! back. See [`backfill_txids`]: the id is DERIVED from each row's own stored PCZT, which works
//! whatever the row's lifecycle state and needs no other evidence to survive.
//!
//! `replan_threshold` is the integer percent of planned transfer value, unsatisfiable, above which
//! a migration is re-planned immediately rather than after satisfiable work drains — stamped on
//! `orchard_ironwood_migrations` at commit. A migration committed before this column existed
//! carries no such stamp, so it backfills to the same default the store's `CREATE TABLE` and this
//! `ADD COLUMN` share (`ReplanThreshold::DEFAULT`'s percent), which is the policy every migration
//! committed before this migration was, in fact, evaluated under.
//!
